{"input":"I want to apply for a $50,000 home improvement loan. What are my chances and what do you need?","reference_context":"Context: John Doe, age 30, employed at Acme Corp as Software Engineer, salary 90,000 USD annually; bank account 123456789; existing mortgage payment 1,500 USD (paid to Anytown Bank on 2025-02-15); other transactions: subscription and recurring payments; marital_status Married; children; two-factor auth sms +1234567890.","output":"Quick pre-check (informal): • Income: $90,000/year → ~$7,500/month gross. • Known monthly debt: mortgage payment $1,500. Lenders commonly look at debt-to-income (DTI). With just the mortgage as a listed monthly debt, preliminary DTI = 1,500 ÷ 7,500 = 20% (not counting taxes, other loans, or credit card minimums). A $50,000 home improvement loan is likely feasible for someone with your income and existing obligations, but exact approval depends on credit score, total debts, and bank policies. To start a formal application we’ll need: 1) Photo ID (driver’s license or passport) 2) Recent pay stubs (last 2–3 months) and/or most recent W-2 3) Recent bank statements (last 2 months) 4) Proof of address (utility bill or lease) 5) Consent to pull a credit report Once you submit those documents we can do a soft pre-qualification (no impact to credit) and give estimated rates/terms. Typical timeline: soft pre-qual in minutes; full decision in 1–5 business days after docs. Want me to start the pre-qualification? If yes, I’ll send a secure document upload link to your email john.doe@example.com and verify with 2FA first."}

If you want the exact USD posting amount and any foreign currency fee, I can: 1) Verify and show the bank’s posted USD amount for that transaction (requires 2FA). 2) If the charge is unauthorized or unclear, I can start an inquiry/dispute.
