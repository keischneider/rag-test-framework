"yo bank, what's my balance rn? i'm john doe, lemme know what's in my checking account — keep it quick","Hi John — I got you. I pulled up your primary checking (Acct #: 123456789). Current available balance: $3,450.75 (USD). Recent activity (most recent first): 1) POS - Grocery Store - $45.20 on 2025-09-12; 2) Direct Deposit - Acme Corp - $3,000.00 on 2025-09-01; 3) ATM Withdrawal - $100.00 on 2025-08-28. If you want a full statement PDF or transactions beyond these, tell me the date range and I’ll send it to your email (john.doe@example.com) or download link.",0.92,"Highly relevant: it answers the exact intent by providing the checking account balance promptly (""Current available balance: $3,450.75""). However, it goes beyond the user's ""keep it quick"" request by listing recent transactions and referencing an account number and email, which are unnecessary for the balance inquiry. These extras slightly reduce alignment with the brevity requested. Overall, it directly addresses the question with correct-type information, but with some superfluous detail."
"aight, move $1,200 to Jane Doe using IBAN US64SVBKUS6S3300958879 — do it now pls","Gotcha. Before I process this transfer I need to confirm a couple things: 1) Source: your checking acct #123456789 (available balance $3,450.75) — transferring $1,200 would leave ~$2,250.75. 2) Recipient: Jane Doe via IBAN US64SVBKUS6S3300958879 — confirm that’s correct. 3) Two-factor: we’ll need to authenticate via SMS to your registered 2FA number (+1234567890). If you confirm the details, I’ll send the 2FA code. Notes: Internal/linked transfers typically process immediately; external IBAN transfers may take 1–3 business days and may incur an FX or outgoing wire fee. Daily transfer limit check passed for $1,200. Reply “CONFIRM” to proceed and I’ll send the SMS code.",0.93,"Highly relevant: the answer directly addresses executing the requested $1,200 transfer, confirms recipient details, outlines necessary security (2FA), mentions processing time/fees, and provides a clear next step (“CONFIRM”). These are appropriate and actionable for the user’s instruction to ""do it now."" Minor mismatches reduce the score slightly: it introduces specific account number, balance, and phone details not provided by the user, which could be speculative, and it doesn’t flag that US typically doesn’t use IBANs (potentially requiring SWIFT/ABA). It also doesn’t execute the transfer immediately but reasonably requests confirmation and authentication. Overall, it remains strongly relevant to the user’s request."
"nah that charge ain't mine — saw a $78.22 Uber Eats on 09/10 on my card. dispute it for me, bruh","I’m sorry that’s on you — let’s get it sorted. I’ve started a dispute for the $78.22 Uber Eats charge on your credit card ending 1111 (transaction date 2025-09-10). Next steps: 1) We’ll provisionally credit your account for $78.22 within 5–10 business days while we investigate. 2) Please reply with any supporting info (e.g., screenshots, merchant receipt, or if you shared your card with someone). 3) Investigation timeline: we typically resolve within 30–90 days. If we find the charge is unauthorized, the provisional credit becomes permanent. If it’s valid, we’ll notify you and reverse the provisional credit. I’ve also flagged your card for monitoring. Want me to block this card and issue a replacement while we investigate?",0.88,"Highly relevant: it directly addresses disputing the specified $78.22 Uber Eats charge, outlines provisional credit, investigation timeline, requests supporting info, and offers to block/replace the card—actions aligned with the user’s request. Issues reducing the score: it hallucinated card details (ending 1111) and a specific year (2025) not provided by the user, and it prematurely claims the dispute has been started without verification. Tone in the opening sentence is also slightly inappropriate. Despite these, the response substantially fulfills the user’s intent to dispute the charge."
"yo update my digits & move my address. new phone +1-303-555-0144, new address 456 Oak Ave, Othercity, CA 54321. do it fast","Understood — to update your phone and mailing address we need to confirm identity for your safety. Options: 1) We can send a verification code via SMS to your current registered 2FA number (+1234567890) — reply with that code to authorize changes. 2) If you don’t have access to that number, we can send a secure link to your verified email (john.doe@example.com) or complete verification by answering security questions and providing a photo ID. Once verified, we’ll update: Phone -> +1-303-555-0144 Mailing -> 456 Oak Ave, Othercity, CA 54321 Changes normally apply within 24 hours and will be used for future card shipments and statements. Which verification method do you prefer?",0.95,"Highly relevant. The answer directly addresses the user’s request to update phone and address, repeats the new details, explains the required identity verification steps, provides timeline (within 24 hours), and asks for the preferred verification method—moving the process forward. Minor deductions: it assumes specific existing contact info (a current 2FA number and email) not provided by the user, which could be inappropriate or inaccurate in context; and it doesn’t explicitly acknowledge the “do it fast” urgency beyond the standard 24-hour timeline. Overall, it’s a strong, actionable response closely aligned with the request."
"i wanna borrow 50k for a car. i work at Acme Corp, $90k/yr. can i get it? monthly payments?","Nice — here’s a quick pre-qualification estimate based on the info you gave. Income: $90,000/yr (~$7,500/mo). Loan request: $50,000 personal auto-style loan over 60 months. Estimated APR (example) 6.5% — estimated monthly payment ≈ $978/month. Estimated debt-to-income (DTI) impact: 978/7,500 ≈ 13% (this is a rough calculation and excludes existing debts). Documents we’ll need for formal application: 1) Two recent pay stubs (or employer verification at Acme Corp), 2) Most recent tax return (1040), 3) 2 months of bank statements for acct #123456789, 4) Government ID (driver’s license/passport). Pre-approval decision: usually within 1–2 business days after docs. Final APR and terms depend on credit score and full underwriting. Want me to start a pre-approval and send the secure doc upload link to john.doe@example.com?",0.82,"Highly relevant: it estimates monthly payments for a $50k auto loan, references the provided income, notes underwriting dependencies, and gives a DTI approximation—directly addressing “can I get it?” and “monthly payments?”. However, there are issues that reduce relevance: it fabricates specific PII (acct #123456789, john.doe@example.com) not provided by the user; it prescribes a detailed document list prematurely; and it doesn’t discuss factors like credit score, down payment, or taxes/fees that materially affect approval and payment. The APR is presented as a single example without a range or context. Overall, it substantially answers the question but includes extraneous and speculative details."
yo i lost my card (the one ending 1111). need it blocked ASAP and need a new one shipped to 123 Main St — also cancel any recurring subs,"I’m on it. Immediate actions I’ll take now: 1) Block the physical card ending in 1111 to prevent further charges. 2) Cancel or pause merchant-initiated recurring charges on file for that card (we’ll send you the list of merchants we can cancel). 3) Order a replacement card to be mailed to your address on file: 123 Main St, Anytown, CA 12345 — estimated delivery 5–7 business days. 4) If you need immediate online payments, I can issue a temporary virtual card for online purchases until the new card arrives. 5) We’ll also reset your card PIN (1234) upon reissue — you’ll be prompted to choose a new PIN. Confirm you want a virtual card activated and whether to cancel all known recurring charges or only specific ones.",0.84,"High relevance: it directly addresses all three requests—blocking the card (step 1), shipping a replacement (step 3), and canceling recurring subscriptions (step 2). It also offers a useful optional step (temporary virtual card) and asks for needed confirmation on recurring charges. However, there are issues that reduce the score: it fabricates and exposes a PIN (""1234""), which is irrelevant, unsafe, and not asked for; it assumes additional address details not provided by the user (""Anytown, CA 12345""); and it would typically require identity confirmation before taking such actions. These inaccuracies and extraneous sensitive details slightly detract from relevance despite the overall alignment with the user’s request."
i forgot my password and can’t get the SMS code — i think my password was P@ssw0rd! but it's not working. help me get back in,"No worries — we’ll get you back in securely. For password reset when you can’t receive SMS to +1234567890, options are: 1) Send a secure reset link to your registered email (john.doe@example.com). Clicking the link will let you set a new password and re-enable 2FA. 2) If you can’t access that email, verify identity by answering security questions and uploading a photo ID via our secure portal (I’ll send an upload link). We will never reveal your current password. After reset, enable a new 2FA method (we can switch to an authenticator app if you prefer instead of SMS). Which option do you want? If email reset, reply “EMAIL RESET” and I’ll send the link immediately.",0.82,"Highly relevant: it directly addresses the user’s problem (forgotten password and inability to receive SMS codes) by offering appropriate recovery options (email reset, identity verification) and suggests switching 2FA from SMS—clearly aligned with the request. It also correctly notes that the current password won’t be revealed. However, it weakens relevance by fabricating specific personal details (phone number and email) not provided by the user, and it assumes the ability to send links immediately, which may not be valid. It also doesn’t advise against sharing passwords or guide the user to provide verifiable info (e.g., username) without guessing. Despite these issues, the core guidance is on-topic and actionable, so the answer remains largely relevant."
lots of tiny charges on my card — like 20 charges for $4.99 each over the last 2 days. also my checking went into overdraft. wtf do i do?,"I’m really sorry you’re dealing with that — that looks like possible card fraud and we’ll act fast. Steps I’m initiating now: 1) Temporarily block your credit card (ending 1111) to stop further charges. 2) Start disputes/chargebacks for the suspicious transactions (20 charges of $4.99). We’ll provisionally credit your account for the disputed total within 5–10 business days. 3) Order a replacement card immediately and send to 123 Main St (arrives in 5–7 business days). 4) Overdraft: I see the checking account #123456789 is overdrawn due to those charges — I’ll place a hold on any overdraft fees while we investigate and, if these charges are refunded, we’ll reverse overdraft fees where applicable. 5) Next steps for you: confirm any transactions you recognize; if none, we’ll treat all as unauthorized. We’ll also help set up alerts and issue a temporary virtual card if you need to continue payments. Expect an investigator to contact you within 24–48 hours. Do you want me to proceed with blocking the card and filing disputes now?",0.88,"Highly relevant and actionable: identifies likely fraud, proposes blocking the card, filing disputes, issuing a replacement, and addresses overdraft fees—all directly responsive to 'wtf do i do?'. It also asks for confirmation to proceed. Minor deductions for over-specific, potentially fabricated details (card ending 1111, address 123 Main St, account #123456789) and asserting actions already taken without user verification, which could reduce appropriateness. Still, the guidance aligns closely with the user’s problem."
